## Project description


**The website can crash during the sessions, because search amount is limited from API provider**

```
This is a website where you can enter any food or product name
and get the nutrition data about it.
Also user is receiving the "Nutrition Score" of this product,
which is showing how useful this product is for you and your
health.
If you got "A" you can go to the gym now,
but if you have "E" it is better to wait some time. 
```



## About the team

during the final modules of the studying process in
